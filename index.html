    <p>As Fiji prepares to mark the 146th Girmit Day, 97-year-old Shiu Kumari from Wainikoro, Labasa, recounts powerful memories of the indenture period and a personal story of separation and hope lost.</p>

    <p>In a video posted on the Fiji Government Facebook page, Kumari shared that her grandfather was among the Girmitiyas who arrived in Fiji during the indenture period.</p>

    <p>She says she has forgotten the exact place in India her grandparents came from, but remembers their journey to Fiji vividly through the stories passed down to her.</p>

    <p>Her father, who worked in sugarcane fields, once gave his wages to his parents. Her grandfather returned to India promising to come back — but he never did. Her grandmother waited her entire life for her husband’s return, eventually passing away with that hope unfulfilled.</p>

    <p>Kumari also described how many indentured labourers came to Fiji with no money or clothes. The journey was harsh, with women lacking basic necessities, and passengers forced to sleep sitting upright or huddled together.</p>

    <p>Upon arrival, men and women were separated and made to choose life partners from line-ups — a beginning to what would become Fiji’s Indo-Fijian community.</p>

    <p>The 146th Girmit Day’s theme is <strong>"Preserving the Past, Envisioning the Future."</strong> Celebrations will take place from Saturday through Monday at Subrail Park in Labasa. Monday, 12th May is a public holiday.</p>
