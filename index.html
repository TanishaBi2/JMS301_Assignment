<p>As Fiji commemorates the 146th anniversary of Girmit Day, 97-year-old Shiu Kumari from Wainikoro, Labasa, has shared a moving account of her family's connection to the indenture system and the enduring impact it has had on her life. In a video posted on the Fiji Government’s official Facebook page, Kumari offered a personal and emotional reflection on the sacrifices made by her ancestors who came to Fiji under the British colonial indenture system.</p>

<p>Kumari revealed that her grandfather was among the thousands of Girmitiyas — indentured labourers brought from India to Fiji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to work primarily on sugarcane plantations. While she no longer remembers the exact village in India her grandparents came from, she grew up listening to stories of their arduous journey and struggles in a new land.</p>

<p>She recalled that her father worked in the sugarcane fields and would give his earnings to his parents. Eventually, her grandfather returned to India, vowing to return to Fiji. However, he never came back. Her grandmother spent the rest of her life waiting for her husband’s return, clinging to hope until she passed away — a painful symbol of separation that many families of Girmitiyas experienced.</p>

<p>Kumari painted a vivid picture of the suffering endured by the indentured labourers during their voyage to Fiji. She described how most of them arrived without money or proper clothing. The journey by ship was long and harsh, with women lacking basic necessities and many passengers forced to sleep while sitting upright or in tightly packed spaces. Upon arrival in Fiji, men and women were separated and made to choose life partners from line-ups, beginning the formation of what would become the Indo-Fijian community.</p>

<p>This year’s Girmit Day is themed <em>“Preserving the Past, Envisioning the Future.”</em> National celebrations are being held at Subrail Park in Labasa from Saturday through Monday. Monday, 12th May, is designated as a public holiday in recognition of the day’s historical and cultural significance.</p>

<p>Shiu Kumari’s heartfelt memories serve as a reminder of the resilience, sacrifices, and legacy of the Girmitiyas — a legacy that continues to shape Fiji’s identity and multicultural heritage today.</p>
